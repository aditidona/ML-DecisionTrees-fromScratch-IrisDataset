# ML-DecisionTrees-fromScratch-IrisDataset

For Iris dataset, print steps for every split in the decision tree.
My Project is divided in 2 parts -
1. Print the Decision tree steps.
2. Decision Tree Implementation:  Building actual decision tree using classes and OPPS for the dataset and then printing it.
